     * Many companies use telephone numbers like 555-GET-FOOD so the number is 
     * easier for their customers to remember. On a standard telephone, the 
     * alphabetic letters are mapped to numbers in the following fashion:
     *   ABC = 2
     *   DEF = 3
     *   GHI = 4
     *   JKL = 5
     *   MNO = 6
     *   PQRS = 7
     *   TUV = 8
     *   WXYZ = 9
     * Complete the following method, phoneTranslator(String str) so that:
     *   1) It verifies the phone number is of the form XXX-XXX-XXXX, if not, 
     *      it returns null.
     *   2) If the phone number is valid, it returns a copy of the argument with 
     *      all letters translated into digits using the above scheme.
     * For example: phoneTranslator("555-GET-FOOD") should return "555-438-3663"
     * and phoneTranslator("01-80-555-0923") should return null.
